# Deepfake-Detection-using-LSTM-and-ResNext

**Introduction**
Deepfake technology, powered by advanced deep learning algorithms, has emerged as a significant threat to modern society by enabling the creation of highly convincing forged media. Deep Fakes manipulate audiovisual content, often superimposing individuals' faces onto different bodies or generating fabricated speeches, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy invasion, and potential misuse. This research focuses on the development and evaluation of deep learning-based models such as CNN, RNN, RestNext and LSTM for detecting deepfake videos. Furthermore, we discuss potential challenges and future directions for deepfake detection research, emphasizing the importance of continued advancements in this field to stay ahead of evolving deepfake generation techniques. Ultimately, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat the misuse of deepfake technology and safeguard the integrity of digital media and public discourse.
